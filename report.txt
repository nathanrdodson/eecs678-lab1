If we initialize 'unintialized_value' that will mitigate any issues with it being uninitialized.

Within the for loop, we need to free the pointer that is generically pointing to the heap, and then free the list of generic void (double)? pointers on the heap.
This must be donee within the for loop so it is in scope.

Lastly, we need to free still_reachable, and then free possibly_lost (while explicitly adjusting for the change in position '+= 4').
